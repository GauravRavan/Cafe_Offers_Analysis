# Maven Rewards Challenge - Marketing Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard created for the Maven Rewards Challenge, where I took on the role of Sr. Marketing Analyst at Maven Cafe. This project analyzes customer activity data to identify key customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging and targeting.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, different combinations of promotional offers were sent to rewards members over a 30-day test period. My task was to analyze the collected data, track customer engagement with various offers, and uncover insights on customer behavior and offer effectiveness.

## Data Sources
The analysis leverages three data tables:
- **Offers**: Contains details of each promotional offer, including offer type, reward, and channels.
- **Customers**: Includes customer demographic information such as age, gender, income, and membership join date.
- **Events**: Tracks customer activity, including transactions, offer views, and completions, over a 30-day period.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
1. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Categorized customers based on join date and demographics, such as age and income.
   - Created categories: *Legacy* (joined 2013-14), *Old* (joined 2015-17), and *Recent* (joined 2018 onwards).

2. **Offer Performance Tracking**:
   - Visualized the count of offers completed by different customer segments (age, income, and join categories).
   - Analyzed offer effectiveness by offer type and reward values.

3. **Timeline Analysis**:
   - Created a line chart to show the number of offers completed over days.
   - Converted event timestamps to days to better align with the 30-day challenge period.

## Key Insights
- **Top-performing Offer Types**: Analyzed which offer types resonated the most with customers, based on completion rates.
- **Customer Demographic Preferences**: Observed completion rates by age, gender, income, and customer join category.
- **Engagement Patterns Over Time**: Visualized customer engagement trends throughout the 30-day period, highlighting peak and low activity periods.
